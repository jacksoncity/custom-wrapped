Web based statistics aggregator to be a sort of "Wrapped" for foobar2000 users who have the Playback Statistics Component installed on their system.

Most information gathered that isnt from Playback Statistics is gathered from the metedata from FLAC files.

FLAC FILES ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT WILL READ EXTRA INFORMATION.

However, all file types are counted in the playback statistics; just don't expect to see top albums, artists, etc. if you don't have FLAC files as your primary file type.

Inside is also a test .xml that i took randomly from my computer, please feel free to use it for testing purposes.

Instructions:

- Inside of foobar2000 go to Library > Playback Statistics > Export Statistics > Settings to your liking. (It is recommended to leave all Fields as enabled.)
- Execute the Python application and open the link to your localhost in a webbrowser
- Upload your exported xml file and click submit

Enjoy :)
