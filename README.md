Basic cli statistics aggregator to be a sort of "Wrapped" for foobar2000 users who have the Playback Statistics Component installed on their system. 

Most information gathered that isnt from Playback Statistics is gathered from the metedata from FLAC files. 
FLAC FILES ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT WILL READ EXTRA INFORMATION. 
However, all file types are counted in the playback statistics; just don't expect to see top albums, artists, etc. if you don't have FLAC files as your primary file type.

Instructions:
- Inside of foobar2000 go to Library > Playback Statistics > Export Statistics > Settings to your liking. (It is recommended to leave all Fields as enabled.)
- Drag the exported xml file into the same folder as the Python application.
- Execute the Python application and follow the steps as listed on the app.

Enjoy :)
